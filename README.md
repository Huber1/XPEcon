# XPEcon
This is an Economy Plugin for Minecraft Paper Servers

It implements the [Vault API](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/), so Vault needs to be installed

## Features
- `/eco` and `/balance` commands to manage levels (standard xp command can also be used, but the bukkit xp method is inaccurate on big values)
- offline player support
- compatible with anything that uses [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
